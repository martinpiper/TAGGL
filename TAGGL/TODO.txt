Could probably do with some fake sample headers to stop a handler exception at startup



// MPi: TODO: 04/15 = misc parameters (if added using add_world)



// MPi: TODO: I think this needs some template data words ARM memory setup



Look at merging BHP Track3 with Game. Load Game first then Track3?
Check the original applicaton, it might load control first, then check handlers.



Systems and Worlds, they need compiled (loaded) and live data. They get reinitialised from the compiled data.
Every loaded resource need this allocated in the ARM memory:
00/03 = ptr to compiled resource data
04/07 = ptr to live resource data       
08/11 = internal use  (bounding box size if template resource)
12/15 = internal use  
16/31 = resource name (padded with spaces)
Don't worry about the vertex list updating for the MIME demo. Instead optimise for the general case which is static model verts.
The live system and world data needs to be split into functions so the live data can be quickly converted to the C++ forma for each frame.
Basically if the pre-frame code handler is called then mark the world template as dirty as well as the system.
Then update data for those dirty objects from the live data.



Run the collision update and the event



Add TAG function 8118



Breakpoint on unimplemented TAG functions in CallbackTAGFunction.
Then implement.



Transparency. The problem with this is that is uses face flags. Not sprite mask data.






Move sTheARM into a new instance within ARMCore



If a handler generates an exception then warn once if debug is turned on and stop it from running in the future.
The exception will need to be passed back from ARMCore.



Check the object scale is fed through from the world template.



Also check the world template scale is copied over.

Optimise the model draw to use compiled GL.
// MPi: TODO: Instead of verts per triangle use glGenLists, glNewList and GL_COMPILE for the base object
